                                <p>One of the only guarantees in life is that is ends. It is unpredictable when that may happen so no matter how old or young, it is imperative to take care of your family’s future. Creating an estate plan ensures you avoid the stress, long drawn-out time and financial costs associated with probate court. When a person dies, the main goal is to transfer the assets directly to the named person (beneficiary) without having to deal with the probate court. This can be accomplished various ways depending on each client’s situation and preferences.</p>

                                <p>Estate planning includes a legally binding will, allows you to direct that what you own goes where and to who you want it too. If a person passes away without a will in the state of Ohio, their assets get distributed based on Ohio law. Having a will makes the process more efficient when you are no longer around to ensure things run smoothly.</p>

                                <p>Sometimes, another good way to avoid probate that makes more sense for some clients is to have an attorney draft a legally binding contract that ensures your assets are distributed a certain way during and after your life. This is called a trust! You can decide to be the initial trustee to maintain control of your assets and then when you pass away the trust can distribute your assets the way you want instead of having to deal with probate.
